# Beanie Lang

Beanie is a modern mid to low-level language that priotizes 3 main things.

1. Familiarity for Java, C#, and C++ developers
2. Maximum Control, allowing very performant code
3. Simple syntax, the code in Beanie should be obvious and simple to read for anyone who has some level of experience with C-Style syntaxed languages

## Getting Started

Get started with learning this language by going to [features](doc/features.md). Where all the main features are explained, with small features sprinkled in the examples for the main features

## Current Progress

Currently, Beanie is a language specification with no implementations. 
But plans are in place to first implement a working interpreter of Beanie, 
LSP, then a LLVM compiler will be implemented after along with a package
manager.
